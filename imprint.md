## About

I’ve been obsessed with the web since 1994—the days of NSCA Mosiac and 14.4k baud modems. I built my website a couple of months after making my first click and haven’t really stopped rebuilding it since. From architecture school to a job as a software architect, from Dallas to Bay Area to Portland to Berlin and to every corner of the world, the web has been a big part of my life since then.

There are many websites. This one is mine. I will probably keep reinventing it as long as I breathe. Or until this whole web thing blows over.

## Legal Bits

I make no guarantees about the longevity or permanency of anything I post here. While embarrassing moments can seemingly live forever on the web, this site evolves at my whim and discretion. Don’t take it personally. The [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) is your friend.
