In the process of moving to Berlin, I set up a couple of services to keep a workable US-based presence. First, I set up a mailing address with [Earth Class Mail](https://www.earthclassmail.com), which has worked out amazingly well. It’s remakably easy to toss out junk mail, scan the important stuff, and even forward on the occasional package, important document, or even occasional paper check. As you might imagine, dealing with paper checks from afar is a pain in the ass, but at least it’s doable.

Keeping a US-based phone number hasn’t worked out quite as well. I ported my Verizon cell phone number to [Google Voice](http://google.com/voice), and for voice calls it’s fine. The voice mail transcriptions are a bit laughable at times, but at least they give a sense of the message left so that you know if it’s worth listening to. The primary reason I went with Google Voice, however, was because of its support for SMS messages—especially during the first few months when I was using a temporary number in Germany and wanted to preserve the ability to use SMS for backup two-factor authentication for the various services I use.

Unfortunately, this didn’t work out as smoothly as I’d hope. While Google Voice does support inbound SMS, the support isn’t 100% there. Messages from some services arrive just fine. Some messages from other services, however—such as Apple and Twitter—are sporadic at best. They worked when I first ported the number over, but then only worked occasionally later.

This left me in a bit of a pickle at one point when I needed to get an authentication code from Apple and my iPhone wasn’t getting codes because it was between countries and was showing up as disabled in Apple’s list of trusted devices. For a little bit, I was seriously considering porting my phone number *back* to Verizon or AT&T for a month just so I could get that one necessary text. Thankfully, one day recently, I tried it again and the SMS code came through to Google Voice and I quickly set up my German phone number as an additional backup SMS number.

Lesson learned: Set up a trusted friend’s phone as a backup phone before dorking about with your primary phone numbers.

At this point, I’m not convinced I’m going to keep Google Voice. While it’s supports in Hangouts is nice, it’s not much different than Skype. In many ways, Skype is a better tool for the job at hand. And, since it’s not clear how important the product is to Google, there’s no telling how long they’ll keep Voice going.
